Uffda.

I apparently have a lot of things I want to do. This post initially started out as setting out
my professional development goals for work, but it's kinda ~~blossomed~~ snowballed from there.
Some of them are specific to developing skills that would only benefit me professionally, but
there are some personal goals that I think would greatly benefit my career or my fitness to
tackle my work.

<!--more-->

### 1. Bullet Journaling
My team does a daily stand up where we discuss what we did yesterday and what we plan on
undertaking the next day. I always gloss over what happened yesterday because I've put it behind
me already, and never really know what I'm gonna to today because I haven't thought about what
is next to get done.

My first goal is to start practicing using a [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com) daily
both for my to-do list and for reflection on that which I have done. The most direct impact of
this habit would be to make be a more reliable Scrum Team member which should have direct
workplace benefits of increasing my colleague's and my own confidence in my work ethic. I might
also see increases in productivity and stronger direction on the effort I put into following the
remainder of my goals.

As this goal is to establish a habit, I will know that I've succeeded if I am regularly using
my bujo to keep track of my work. I hope that by my winter 2019 review that I am at least
placing an entry for every work day. Bonus points for some reflective prose for most days.

### 2. Personal Fitness
Wouldn't everyone like to put 'getting in shape' on their work goals? But wouldn't Management
think that it's a bit superfluous and too personal for the Powers That Be to condone? I think
this attitude is hogwash: if employers want to get the most out of their employees, they must
encourage their employees to take care of themselves. For me, physical activity is quite
effective at regulating my stress and mental well being, and so getting back into shape will
enable me to be more resilient under pressure and more effective at the work I do. Ultimately
this would make me a more valuable asset to the company.

This too is habit building, which I make success kinda awkward to measure, but regularly
performing three days of bodyweight exercises (with pull-ups, squats, push-ups and bodyline
work at a minimum) would be my aim.

### 3. Build a Convolutional Neural Network
Now we get to something that is a bit more obvious in its relevance to my career. Since I've
completed the Stanford/Coursera introduction to Machine Learning course, I'm eager to try to
apply this information to some project just to start getting a feel of how to set something up.
I've already done the work to scrap all of [The Sartorialist](https://thesartorialist.com/)'s
"On The Streetâ€¦" images with their categories and tags.

I believe that my first attempt could be possibly starting some sort of image segmentation,
separating the figure from the ground, or some sort of silhouette identification. This goal
is possibly the most vaguely thought out at the moment and it'll require some research for
reasonable execution.

### 4. Blogging
I would also like to get better at writing. Maintaining this blog would good a good way into
the practice that I would need to improve my prose. I initially started this as a place to put
my notes and experiences working on my personal projects, but I have failed to do that. Some of
the difficulties I find have been not feeling that the work I've done is really worth putting
to paper or not being able to think of what I would even write about after completing some unit
of work.

Additionally, writing seems to take me quite a bit of time to do. I'm not entirely certain that
this is because I myself am slow at it or if it just takes quite a bit of time to do. It's taken
me a very diligent 75 minutes to write ten times as many words. Hopefully, with practice, I will
be able to speed up this process.

Luckily, with the bujo and my retrospection involved in my first goal, especially how it
pertains to my development, I should begin to be able to think of more things to commit to
this blog. Hopefully, and I would count this as initial success, would be that I'm writing at
least two entries a month, with at least one of them being devoted to some technology I've
worked with in that time.

### 5. Personal Site Desktop CSS
Finally, I've had the mobile-oriented styling on this very site complete for two months, and I have
yet to complete the styling for standard computer screens. If I can get the styles set up for
desktop viewing, it would go a fair way at getting me to think holistically about how to layout
web pages. I already have thumbnail designs for how I want the pages lain out, and a rough idea of
how to use CSS Grid to get me there. Executing this vision will also help me learn how to organize
my SCSS files, which we are currently, if slowly, migrating towards at work.

These five items are just the surface of all the things I want to accomplish. However, I do believe
that these are thoughtful steps to help me take on greater undertakings in the future.
